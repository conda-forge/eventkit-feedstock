  summary: Event-driven data pipelines
  description: |
    The primary use cases of eventkit are
      * to send events between loosely coupled components;
      * to compose all kinds of event-driven data pipelines.
    The interface is kept as Pythonic as possible, with familiar names from Python and its libraries where possible. 
    For scheduling asyncio is used and there is seamless integration with it.
